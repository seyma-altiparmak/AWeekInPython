Day 5 :
As I pass the last two days of the test myself, of course, I will not be able to get full efficiency because I do not continue the series of CO.
But today I was very impressed with BK's Bot writing style and strangely thought I should write too.
I wrote two different instagram bots:
1. Bulk follow request (Series Follow Nephew code)
2. I couldn't even try to test and remove those who don't do GT, but I could also print their names on the screen. uwu is a code that says this.
Both were great experiences for me.
I have absorbed it to the root, I can sleep comfortably.
I've come to the end of BK's courses to switch to CO tomorrow and progress through it and
Then I want to write a few apps.
After solving the questions, my challenge will be completed.
