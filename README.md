    First of all, I must say that I will not copy the codes of atil samancioglu or ceyhun ozdemir. I did not get permission from our teachers about this. It would not be correct for me to copy. Also, I don't think I will need to copy after the course I took with the battal coach and the articles I read. I will attach my own comments about the courses to a file of the document.
