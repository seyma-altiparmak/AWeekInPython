Day 2 :
I watched OOP videos today, but I don't think it's very effective on me.
I understand the Class structure but the "_init_" structure
I couldn't understand the constructor setup parts...
That's a huge miss!
Since I was not satisfied with the OOP tutorials, I started w3schools.com -> solving python tests.
By the way, the second question seems wrong.
I learned from w3school that the """""" structure is multiple lines of #.
As for naming, I learned that '-' is forbidden. (My ignorance) :(
I learned that to define a global it is enough to type global (It felt like in heaven).
I had no idea about tuple, still don't. I am looking now:
immutable data type -- (I'll add the source right away) -> in README.md
---------------NUMBERS---------------
The converter to complex number is just complex, it still works wonders.
---------------STRINGS---------------
len(str) : find the length of the string.
txt[0] : textin the first element
any whitespace = .strip()
.upper() .lower()
.replace("H","J") placeholder = {}
-------------------------------------
0 = False
1 = True
-------------------------------------
add = append
------------------------------------

See you in my free time tomorrow... ðŸ™Œ
