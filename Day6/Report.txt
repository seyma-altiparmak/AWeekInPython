DAY 6:
In the beginning : Enough of the problems caused by selenium on the sixth day :
I threw the libraries into pycharm.
Then I looked at the second day of C.O. Then, to see my level
I thought I'd do the tests. I can complete the week's tasks but more for projects
I have a way to go, the level I have reached for a week is fine and I leave quietly.
