Day 1:
-> tutorials watched
-> articles read
-> experimented up to loops.
The day passed with my mastery of the python language in general.
Of course I can't be an expert in a week, but my progress was satisfactory (for me).
I respect Python for its ease of writing.
I'm still inclined to C# let's see if this one week will change that.
I'm trying to master Syntax.
Day 2 is my goal to gain complete dominance and learn OOP.
